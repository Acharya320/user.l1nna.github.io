***Course Description***: Inductive modelling of data, especially counting models; ensemble approaches to modelling; maximum likelihood and density-based approaches to clustering, visualization. Applications to non-numeric datasets such as natural language, social networks, Internet search, recommender systems. Introduction to deep learning. Ethics of data analytics.

This year we move the course material to be hosted directly through your onQ page.
<!-- 

***Degree Planning***: This course is required for the Data Analytics focus of the COMP degree plan. This course is a direct prerequisite to: CISC 451/3.0 (Topics in Data Analytics)

***Textbook***: Lectures plus a range of library and web resources (for the main course content). Optional textbook: Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques, 3rd edition, Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei, 2012. Zaki and Meira. Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms. Cambridge University Press.

***Resources***: For this course, we will use exclusively Python and Google Colab for all the excercises and assignments. All the course notebooks will be posted on our GitHub page <a href="https://github.com/CISC-372">***here***</a>.
