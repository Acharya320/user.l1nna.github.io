Assembly clone search greatly reduces the manual effort of reverse engineering since it can *identify the cloned parts that have been previously analyzed*. By closely collaborating with reverse engineers, I studied the challenges, designed and implemented an award-winning clone search engine called [Kam1n0](https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/Kam1n0-Community). It also includes specialized techniques that can mitigate the variance introduced by different processor families, different compilers, optimization techniques, and binary protection techniques. Kam1n0 has been presented at the Smart Cybersecurity Network Canada (SERENE-RISC), SOPHOS, ESET, Above Security, and Google.
